# Software-Reliability-Project
Project of determination of Software Reliability completed at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur ( IITKgp )
 Literature survey reveals significant efforts have been made to determine the reliability of software systems. Various reliability models have been and tested to determine the chances of its failure which are based on various assumptions. The generic name given to these models is “Software Reliability Models” (SRMs). The main goal of these reliability models is to fit a theoretical distribution to time-between-failure data and failure count data to determine software reliability. As such the success of SRMs is dependent on choice of model.
Verification that the selected model is valid for the available data set usually requires iterations and analysis of the model functions. In the results obtained, prediction of reliability of software is made and comparison of the prediction values by different models is done using graphs. All the above mentioned results, predictions and comparisons were obtained by the software CASRE.
Conclusions
Conclusion drawn from TBF data set-1:
It will take almost 500 days of testing to increase the reliability by around 0.5.It can be expected that next 20 faults will be detected in next 500 days.As failure rate is low as witnessed from the result table, the effort to detect each next fault increases imensely. The time between failure for each next fault increases with each detection.
Conclusion drawn from TBF data set-2:
It can be expected that next 10 faults will be detected in around next 320 days.It will take around 320 days of testing to imprive the reliability by around 0.75.Failure rate is low, the effort to detect each next fault increases. The time between failure for each next fault increases with each detection.
Conclusion drawn from FC data set-1:
The data was executed by NHPP, Schneidewind and Yamada s-shape models. The predicted values given by NHPP and Schneidewind were equal. The predicted value of reliability was very high and grew with a high rate. The failure rate was high hence the effort to detect each next fault increases.
Conclusion drawn from FC data set-2:
